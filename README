Tackled the Bowling Kata at the 2/28/12 Miracle Mile Ruby Night. 

We were lucky to have RSpec core team member @patmaddox among us and he turned a live TDD demo into an exciting parlor game as we passed my laptop around taking turns either writing a test or feature. With @bomatson and @andrewvc

The coffeeshop closed before we solved the bowling 300 test...here's where we left it.
